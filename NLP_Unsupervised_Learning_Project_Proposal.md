NLP_Unsupervised_Learning_Project_Proposal

In my project I am planning to get comments from Twitter where Hungary is tagged. Then I do topic modelling on the exported data to see what context Hungary come up most often.

Hungary adopted a law recently which go against the EU shared values which made the country quite unpopular so I expect many comments relating to politics and EU, but as the country is famous about it's gastronomy, natural beauties and home of a Europe wide famous festival called Sziget I think other topics will appear in my research as well.
